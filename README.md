# Password Manager Software for Systems Security College Class

This work covers a password manager project developed with symmetric AES keys and PBE (Password-Based Encryption).

The goal is to enable an user to store her/his services' passwords in a encrypted PBE system, with a manageable and strong secret password. The first intention is to develop with Python language and then with Javascript.
